# Java Fundamentals: Practical Learning Lab

This repository is a collection of hands-on Java programs designed to master the core foundations of the language. 
Each file focuses on a specific concept, moving from basic syntax to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

## 📚 Learning Roadmap
I have organized the practical files into the following fundamental areas:

### 1. Basic Syntax & Variables
* **Data Types:** Understanding primitives (`int`, `double`, `boolean`) and `String`.
* **Operators:** Arithmetic, logical, and relational operations.

### 2. Control Flow
* **Conditionals:** `if-else` blocks and `switch` statements.
* **Loops:** `for`, `while`, and `do-while` iterations.

### 3. Arrays & Collections
* Single and multi-dimensional arrays.
* Introduction to `ArrayList` for dynamic data.

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Classes & Objects:** The blueprint of Java.
* **Inheritance:** Reusing code across classes.
* **Polymorphism:** Method overriding and overloading.
* **Encapsulation:** Using `private` fields and getters/setters.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java 17+
* **Compiler:** `javac`
* **Editor/IDE:** [e.g., IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code]

## 🚀 How to Run These Files
Since these are individual practical files, you can run them via the terminal:

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/java-fundamentals.git](https://github.com/your-username/java-fundamentals.git)
